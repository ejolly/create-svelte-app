# Components 

This folder is for holding svelte components that get used within `pages/`. Technically these aren't different from each other (components and pages are both just `.svelte` files), but this just provides some organizational project structure. To add new components, just create a `.svelte` file and import it into the appropriate page in `pages/`.
